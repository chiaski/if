            <br>
                 i saw the imprints you left<br>
                 on all your past. in this visitation<br>
                 we do as they say: we start with clean slates defiled only by gods<br>
                 <br>
                 <hr>
                 i'm pressing my knees to the bowels of the earth. on the crests of the war<br>
                 i saw you
                 
                 <br><br>
                 
                 what are we called to do but wait?
                 <br>
                 of cosmic significance
                 <br>
                 to the excrement on the streets
                 <br>
                 to all the forgotten bodies
                 <br>
                 once come out of life
                 <br>
                 where all value withers
                 <br>
                 when i see you
                 <hr>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 i know it's better to not be known
                 <br>
                as i held the lifetime
                 <br>
                 all of it,
                 <br>
                 underneath the eastern seas
                 <br>
                 the skylines you promised
                 <br>
                 the <a href="5.html">murmur of the people</a>
                 <br>
                 and again i am sung to sleep
                 <br>
                 with the same voice that has called me to rise
                 <br>
                 to war
                 <br>
                 to love
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 there are worlds where things cannot co-exist
                 <br>
                 so i went down instead to the balcony
                 <br>
                 to the shutters
                 <br>
                 to the wartime colony
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 this is why people are called to it
                 <br>
                 this is why we be
                 
            
            
             </span>
