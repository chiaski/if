I know this is reminiscent of a hymn
<!--but let me try to help you search for better questions-->
What do you eat today?
<!--your sore throat before its expiry adroit until needed-->
Can a woman be envious?
<!--to shriek alone in holy lands before turned to crypts in my own-->
To find evidence of your good-doing,
<!--it is my own duty to find the names of the fallen-->
so I grow my hair out for Samson
<!--put out cigarettes in bathrooms for Levi-->
searching for him in all scriptures.
<!--Before he was written off he could have served newer gods.-->
Alienation turned me guiltless when I laid dying,
<!--far before the instance where I searched deeper for truth.-->
Then the men and his apparati crowned you and me
<!--in all the false gardens. Then you were exceptional before the fact-->
(if you and me impaled on currents was the sight).
<!--I bowed amongst the seasons then bowed unto you,-->
closing in on eternityâ€“where the turn of the unspeakable
<!--climbs gently into your feet so that I no longer wretch-->
kindly waits for your word.
